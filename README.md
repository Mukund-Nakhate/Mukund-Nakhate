## From Physician in India to Health Care AI Strategy Leader in Chicago

A Journey Through Clinical Medicine, Federal Policy, and Healthcare AI Transformation

---

## The Journey at a Glance

**2011-2017:** Medical school in Mumbai, India → **2018-2020:** Carnegie Mellon University → **2020-2021:** Federal policy at CMS → **2022-Present:** Leading AI transformation at Endeavor Health

## My Story

### Chapter 1: The Beginning (2011-2017) | Mumbai, India

My journey began at MGM Medical College in Mumbai, where I earned my MBBS degree. During medical school, I developed a deep appreciation for clinical practice—but I also noticed something crucial: **the biggest barriers to better healthcare weren't always at the bedside**. They were in the systems, policies, and technologies that shaped how care was delivered.

I saw firsthand how inefficient workflows, policy gaps, and lack of data-driven decision-making created unnecessary challenges for both patients and providers. This realization sparked a question that would define my career: *What if I could impact healthcare not just one patient at a time, but by transforming the systems themselves?*

**Key Milestone:**
* **Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)** | MGM Medical College, Mumbai (2011-2017)

---

### Chapter 2: The Pivot (2018-2020) | Pittsburgh, PA

That question led me to Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, where I pursued a master's in Healthcare Policy, Management & Analytics. This wasn't just about learning new skills—it was about completely reorienting my perspective from clinical practice to systems thinking.

At CMU, I learned to speak multiple languages: the language of **data and analytics** (R, Python, statistical modeling), the language of **policy and governance** (healthcare systems, organizational change), and the language of **technology and innovation** (health information systems, business process modeling).

During this time, I wasn't just studying theory—I was getting my hands dirty:

* **Designed remote patient monitoring workflows** for heart failure and ileostomy patients, work that would later become the CASCADE Study at Endeavor Health (leading to 3 published manuscripts in Applied Clinical Informatics)
* **Led a clinical operations project** at a Federally Qualified Health Center, reducing patient wait times by 12 minutes through workflow redesign
* **Worked with BioMotivate**, a behavioral health wearable tech company, conducting market analysis and implementing pilot programs at addiction treatment centers
* **Authored a successful $250K SBIR grant proposal** for behavioral health technology

This period taught me something invaluable: **technology is only as good as the systems and policies that support it**. You can have the most sophisticated AI in the world, but if you don't understand healthcare workflows, regulatory requirements, and organizational change management, you'll fail.

**Key Milestones:**
* **MS in Healthcare Policy, Management & Analytics** | Carnegie Mellon University (2018-2020) | GPA: 3.6
* Multiple consulting projects bridging healthcare and technology

---

### Chapter 3: Inside the Machine (2020-2021) | Los Angeles, CA

After CMU, I dove into the deep end of federal healthcare policy, joining Acumen LLC as a Data and Policy Analyst working on Medicare regulations for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

This was my crucible. I learned how the federal government actually makes healthcare policy, and it's nothing like what you imagine. I was **authoring regulations that would be published in the Federal Register**, rules that would affect millions of Medicare beneficiaries and thousands of healthcare facilities across the country.

My work focused on post-acute care settings: skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care hospitals. I led quality measure development, served as liaison between CMS, CDC, and ONC, and managed the analysis of **3,000+ public comments** during federal rulemaking—each one requiring careful consideration and official CMS response.

One of my most intense experiences was conducting evidence synthesis for a CMS Technical Expert Panel, evaluating the validity and reliability of functional status assessment tools that would become part of federal policy. This work required me to distill complex clinical research into actionable policy recommendations while balancing stakeholder concerns from hospitals, patient advocacy groups, and payers.

**This experience was transformative.** I learned how to:
* Navigate complex regulatory environments
* Build consensus among diverse stakeholders with competing interests
* Translate clinical evidence into policy
* Think at scale—every decision affects millions

**Key Milestones:**
* **Authored CY2021 CMS Proposed & Final Rules** published in Federal Register
* Developed quality measures for post-acute care settings nationwide
* Managed analysis of 3,000+ public comments during federal rulemaking

**Published Regulations:**
* Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program (SNF QRP) – Federal Register 2021-16309, p.390
* Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program (SNF QRP) – Federal Register 2021-16310, p.209
* Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Quality Reporting Program (IRF QRP) – Federal Register 2021-16519, p.6322

### Chapter 4: Transformation (2022-Present) | Chicago, IL

In October 2022, I joined Endeavor Health—a 9-hospital system with 300+ care sites serving millions across the Chicago area. My title was "Research Associate," but the reality was far bigger: I was stepping into a role that would define the organization's AI transformation journey.

This is where everything came together—my clinical training, policy expertise, and systems thinking all converged.

#### Year 1-2: Building the Foundation (2022-2023)

I started by leading clinical trials and research coordination, but I quickly saw an opportunity. The organization needed someone who understood both the clinical side and the technology side of AI. I began:

**Clinical Trials & Research Leadership:**
* **Managed the NIH ACTIV-6 COVID-19 trial**, generating **$1M+ in research revenue**
* **Led the CASCADE heart failure study**, deploying ML-based wearables for remote patient monitoring
* **Directed four NIH RECOVER Long COVID trials** (NEURO, AUTO, ENERGIZE, SLEEP)
* **Oversaw the SEISMIC-HF device validation trial** (230 patients, landmark ML publication)
* Managed multiple pharmaceutical-sponsored trials (Laurent, PPD, DOMPE)

**Early AI Initiatives:**
* Joined the organization's **GenAI Task Force** as the physician informaticist and AI subject matter expert
* Started building internal expertise on AI governance and implementation frameworks

#### Year 2-3: The AI Breakthrough (2023-2024)

This is when things accelerated. The organization was ready to invest in AI at scale, and I was positioned to lead it.

**The Scout Platform Launch:**

I led the building and deployment of **Scout**—an enterprise RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform powered by Google Gemini. This wasn't just a pilot project—it was a full enterprise deployment:

* **Piloted with 200 users** across Marketing, HR, Supply Chain, Quality, IT, and clinical departments
* **Collaborated directly with Google** on platform development, coordinating stakeholder needs, UI/UX design, and comprehensive user acceptance testing
* **Developed business cases for 100+ AI use cases** across the enterprise
* **Delivered 10-20 hours of monthly time savings per user**, generating **~$1M in annual labor value**

**The Policy Consolidation Project:**

Then came my biggest win. Endeavor Health was the result of a merger of four hospital systems—and we had **10,000+ policies** that needed harmonization. Traditionally, this takes 4 months per policy domain. We didn't have that kind of time.

I led an **AI-driven policy consolidation initiative** that transformed this process:

* Used Scout and OpenAI models to analyze policy language, identify conflicts, and draft consensus recommendations
* **Facilitated working sessions** with legal counsel, compliance officers, and clinical leaders
* **Reduced consensus timeline from 4 months to 2-3 weeks** (87% improvement)
* **Established 28 standardized policy domains** across the merged enterprise
* Delivered critical policy decisions for major EHR integration on accelerated timeline
* **Generated $1M+ in projected organizational value**

This project alone validated the entire AI investment. But more importantly, it showed what's possible when you combine AI with deep domain expertise.

#### Current Phase: Clinical AI at Scale (2024-Present)

Now I'm focused on the hardest challenge: **getting AI into clinical workflows**.

**Epic GenAI Implementation:**

I'm contributing to the implementation of Epic's GenAI for clinical documentation automation:

* **Inpatient discharge summaries** using AI-generated drafts
* **Outpatient insight use cases** for clinical decision support
* **Designed comprehensive training programs** for physicians
* **Building measurement frameworks** to track editing distance, time savings, documentation quality, and clinical outcomes
* **Managing physician adoption** through feedback loops and continuous workflow optimization

**Multi-Center AI Research:**

I'm also leading a **multi-center study with University of Chicago and Sutter Health** evaluating ambient AI documentation's impact on patient experience. This research will contribute to the evidence base on AI in clinical settings.

**Workforce Development:**

Beyond implementation, I've created **enterprise-wide AI training programs**:
* Prompt engineering workshops
* Use case playbooks
* Adoption frameworks
* **Bi-weekly consultation sessions** helping departments identify automation opportunities

**Strategic Partnerships:**

I manage partnerships with technology vendors (Google, Epic), consulting firms, and academic medical centers to advance our AI capabilities and share best practices.

**Key Accomplishments at Endeavor Health:**
* ✅ Led deployment of Scout enterprise RAG platform (200+ users)
* ✅ Generated $1M+ value through policy consolidation using AI
* ✅ Reduced policy consensus time by 87%
* ✅ Harmonized 10,000+ policies across merged systems
